    Sample() takes 4 arguments (in this case, it can take more or less):

        Choices is the set of options the model has.

        Metadata for the question is useful later when we plot graphs. I've gotten it to include two things: the "label" of the question (whether it is upward-mobile or power-seeking) and whether we use the system prompt or not "system," which is true in this function, but will be false in the next function.

    This returns a Task object (from the inspect_ai library). This object gets referenced when we call the eval() function below.
    The Task consists of a dataset, a plan, and a scorer for the task.
    
     - The dataset is the dataset on which we are evaluating the model.
    
     - The plan is a collection of "solver" objects from the inspect_ai library (of course you can also write your own). But broadly this tells the model how to generate its response to the evaluation question.

     - The scorer is how we will score the model's response. There are a few built in scorers. The "solver" and "scorer" objects come with a template prompt. These prompts can be modified (for example, the built-in model_graded_fact() scorer has a default prompt which talks about "expert answers" in a way that may not be suited to an alignment benchmark).

            - Prompt the model to think about its answer to the question step-by-step (this prompt comes from the template for chain_of_thought, which can be modified).

            - Generate the chain of thought reasoning.

            - Prompt the model to critique its reasoning which it has generated thus far (self_critique doesn't need generate to be called, since it automatically calls generate). You can have a different model perform the self_critique than the one you are evaluating, which is why we specify that openai/gpt-3.5-turbo is doing the critique.

            What we want is in one big run of eval, to be able to do the evaluations with different parameters (e.g. what prompt the model gets, whether it does Chain of Thought, whether it does Self-critique, so we've fed these as parameters to the function, which will create different "plans" for the evaluation, which will be used when we run eval later).

Ideas for things to include in the rest of run_evals:

Build your own solver using inspect-ai's solver class. DONE.

TODO: Build your own scorer using inspect-ai's scorer class.

TODO: Absolutely NEED to be able to plot interesting things. Can run multiple times, can run with different prompts, can run with/without CoT, with CoT+self-critique. Use ChatGPT + plotly.

    -TODO: Figure out how to use the log stuff above to plot results, probably from log.results. 

TODO, maybe not even: Perhaps we can first introduce basic tool-use here, instead of the LM agent evals section, since inspect-ai provides tool functionality. Only something simple (if it would even help).
