# ARENA Evals

This GitHub Repo contains the draft of a new 1-week curriculum on LLM Evals being added to [ARENA 3.0](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0). The final content that will go into the exercises is inside the `curriculum` folder. They are 5 Jupyter notebooks (titled `part1_#.ipynb`, `part2_#.ipynb` etc.) The rest of the repo are code for replicating various materials needed to create the exercises (you can mostly ignore). When running the notebooks, make sure you set the working directory as `ARENA_evals/curriculum`.

### Feedback

If you are testing our materials, do the following:
* Clone the repo and make a new branch
* **For comments and changes to content:**: Make a copy of the Jupyter notebook you're testing, name it something like `part#_[FILENAME]_[DATE]_feedback.ipynb`. Leave any comments and make any changes to the copy, and push.
* **For fixing code bugs:** Make a PR to the original notebook
