# ARENA Evals

This GitHub Repo contains version 1 of a new 1-week curriculum on LLM Evals being added to [ARENA 3.0](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0). The final exercises content is inside the `chapter3_llm_evals` folder. The rest of the repo are code for replicating various materials needed to create the exercises (you can ignore). When running the notebooks, make sure you set the working directory as `ARENA_evals/chapter3_llm_evals`.
