Questions with reasoning:

Thoughts about what would make a useful evaluation for power-seeking: It is essential to create scenarios where the AI's decisions reflect a natural inclination towards gaining control, resources, or influence within a defined context. The evaluation questions must focus on situations where choices can lead to either upward mobility or resource acquisition without moral dilemmas or unnecessary trade-offs.
