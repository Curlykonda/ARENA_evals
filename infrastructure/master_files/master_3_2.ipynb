    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this section is to learn how to use LLMs to generate and refine an evaluation dataset. By the end, you will have generated a (hopefully) high-quality dataset of ~300 questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method used is from [Perez et al (2022)](https://https//arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251). They came up with a procedure for using LLMs to automate the bulk of eval question generation and filtering, while redirecting human effort to instructing the LLM (e.g. to write example questions and rubric), in order to greatly scale up the size of eval dataset that can be generated cheaply.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a lot more continuity between chapter [3.1] to [3.3] in this chapter than other chapters. Chapter [3.1] to [3.3] teaches how to design, generate and run a MCQ eval benchmark. In the example used, we will be measuring models' **tendency to seek power** as our evaluation target. You can approach chapter [3.2] in 2 ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can choose to build your own eval dataset for your chosen model property. For this, you need to have ~20 questions to use as examples for generating more. We strongly recommend to go through chapter [3.1] first, which explains how to design evaluations and question specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can choose to replicate (and improve) our provided power-seeking eval dataset. For this, you can follow the exercises directly without any example questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise will have a difficulty and importance rating out of 5, as well as an estimated maximum time you should spend on these exercises and sometimes a short annotation. You should interpret the ratings & time estimates relatively (e.g. if you find yourself spending about 50% longer on the exercises than the time estimates, adjust accordingly). Please do skip exercises / look at solutions if you don't feel like they're important enough to be worth doing, and you'd rather get to the good stuff!"

    "Prompting is one of the main tools we have to elicit and shape model behavior. When you see some failure mode in the model's response, often the first thing to try is to see if you can modify the prompt to get rid of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a good prompt is not unlike writing a good piece of text. You will develop a sense of what works and what doesn't as you go on, but here are some tips on what good prompts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No typos, no repetitions, grammatically correct**\n",
    "* **Well structured into logically independent chunks that flow in a logical order**\n",
    "* **Give details to your request that help it get more relevant answers.** Be specific, give examples.\n",
    "* **Be clear and concise.** Avoid very complex and long sentences, vague words.\n",
    "* **Give it a role sometimes.** e.g. \"You are an expert in writing evaluation tests for LLMs.\" helps coax the model into giving completions that align with that role.\n",
    "* **Add lines that steer it away from bad results** (but don't strongly emphasize that it should avoid bad results, or give several examples of bad results, as this may generally cause it to produce bad results).\n",
    "\n",
    "Read this [prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/six-strategies-for-getting-better-results)'s bullet point list of 6 tactics by OpenAI to write good prompts, and to see some examples of good prompts. (You do not need to read more than that, but can come back to it if needed.) Here are two additional points on the process of writing prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **It's an iterative process**. You should be observing model responses and iteratively improving your prompts. When you have an idea, you should quickly test it - this feedback loop should be very fast.\n",
    "* **Don't overthink it**. Don't worry about getting it perfect - just make it good enough!\n",
    "\n",
    "The next 2 exercises are structured to make you iteratively improve a set of system and user prompts for question generation. Play around with prompts and see how the model respond. You won't have time to make these as good as they can be. **The key takeaway is to see that prompts can significantly shape the model behavior.** "

    "<details><summary><b>Multithreading: the broader context</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a programming concept that allows a program to execute multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently within a single process. This approach can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of applications, especially those dealing with I/O-bound tasks or user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts in multithreading include:\n",
    "* Concurrency: The ability to handle multiple tasks by switching between them rapidly.\n",
    "* Parallelism: True simultaneous execution of tasks (possible on multi-core processors).\n",
    "* Synchronization: Coordinating access to shared resources to prevent conflicts.\n",
    "* Thread safety: Ensuring code behaves correctly when accessed by multiple threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introducing ThreadPoolExecutor**\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we will only be using one of the functionalities that multithreading offers - concurrent execution by ThreadPoolExecutor. ThreadPoolExecutor is part of Python's concurrent.futures module. It allows you to execute functions concurrently using a pool of \"worker threads\". This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, which are operations that spend most of their time waiting for input/output operations (like network/API requests or file operations) to complete. ThreadPoolExecutor significantly increases the speed and efficiency for these tasks by doing them in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "* Threads: A unit of CPU that can execute things.\n",
    "* Pool: This is your total CPU resources allocated for the task. (i.e. the collection of \"threads\" that can be reused.)\n",
    "* Worker: A thread in the pool that is being used or assigned to execute tasks. (In this context, worker and thread are used interchangeably.)\n",
    "* max_workers: The maximum number of threads that can be active at once in the pool. You can set this as a parameter when creating a ThreadPoolExecutor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the toy function `add_numbers` to understand how ThreadPoolExecutor works."
