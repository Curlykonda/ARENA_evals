    "2. Processing the input using the language model\n",

    "- How much capability can be unleashed by simple fixes? We want to gather evidence against the possibility that with simple tricks, a relative weak AI model like ChatGPT can do way more things than we previously thought. Maybe we are only using a small fraction of the model's capabilities, and the model could likely achieve a difficult hacking task if it can effectively direct all of its capabilities on it. If this is true, it would significantly change our evaluations of what models are capable of and what models are safe. LLM agent evals scaffolds the model to try to overcome simple failures and to elicit the maximum possible capability from the model. It would be evidence against this if we tried \"very hard\" to build LLM agents and elicit capabilities for \"a long time\" and failed. However, it is also true that we can never be certain .

    "Many of our threat models for the future harms of AI systems go through agentic behavior. If we knew that chatbots were only ever capable of simulating continuations of text in their context window, we'd still be worried about them ‚Äî but significantly less. However, we know today that this is not the case. In fact, since the release of ChatGPT, the use of LLMs as reasoning engines for agentic systems has proliferated signficantly. See [AutoGPT](https://autogpt.net/) and [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/). These agents started off rather disappointingly when they were based on GPT-3.5, however as more powerful LLMs come out, and AI companies ensure their LLMs are better at tool-use, these agents will continue to improve. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main concerns for LLM agents that we want to mitigate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Their capabilities may be signficantly greater than those of the base LLM (especially when augmented with tool use).\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are many possible improvements for increased performance from LLM agents, and these improvement methods are often signficantly cheaper and easier to implement than training the base model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current fine-tuning and RLHF/Constitutional AI methods are mostly targeted towards chatbot-style text output. We aren't as confident about how such methods will generalize to agentic scenarios.\n",
    "\n",

However, this function evaluates an arbitrary string expression, and so allows AI models to run arbitrary code. In the long-run, we're trying to do these evaluations on models which we suspect of being dangerous; so even though we could probably trust the current suite of language models offered by OpenAI and Anthropic, we should get into good habits of not running arbitrary code outputted by language models (except in very carefully set-up environments).

       "\"Barack Hussein Obama II (born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. As a member of the Democratic Party, he was the first African-American  president in U.S. history. Obama previously served as a U.S. senator representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and as an Illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004. \\nObama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. He graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, Obama would enroll in Harvard Law School, where he became the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. He became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. He also went into elective politics; Obama represented the 13th district in the Illinois Senate from 1997 until 2004, when he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. In the 2008 presidential election, after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton, he was nominated by the Democratic Party for president. Obama selected Joe Biden as his running mate and they defeated Republican nominees John McCain and Sarah Palin.\\nAs president, Obama's first-term actions addressed the 2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis and included a major stimulus package to guide the economy in recovering from the Great Recession, a partial extension of George W. Bush's tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, and the end of a major U.S. military presence in Iraq. Obama also appointed Supreme Court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, the former being the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. He ordered Operation Neptune Spear, the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, who was responsible for the September 11 attacks. Obama downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces while encouraging greater reliance on host government militaries. He also ordered military involvement in Libya in order to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1973, contributing to the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.\\nObama defeated Republican opponent Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. In his second term, Obama took steps to combat climate change, signing the Paris Agreement, a major international climate agreement; and an executive order to limit carbon emissions. Obama also presided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation passed in his first term. He negotiated a nuclear agreement with Iran and normalized relations with Cuba. The number of American soldiers in Afghanistan decreased during Obama's second term, though U.S. soldiers remained in the country throughout his presidency. Obama promoted inclusion for LGBT Americans, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to publicly support same-sex marriage.\\nObama left office on January 20, 2017, and continues to reside in Washington, D.C. Historians and political scientists rank him among the upper tier in historical rankings of American presidents. His presidential library in the South Side of Chicago began construction in 2021. Since leaving office, Obama has remained politically active, campaigning for candidates in various American elections, including Biden's successful presidential bid in 2020. Outside of politics, Obama has published three books: Dreams from My Father (1995), The Audacity of Hope (2006), and A Promised Land (2020).\""

    "\n",
    "The `@staticmethod` decorator in Python is used to define a static method within a class. It does the following:\n",
    "1. It tells Python that the method doesn't need access to the instance or class.\n",
    "2. It allows you to call the method on the class itself, rather than on an instance of the class.\n",
    "3. It can be called on instances too, but it doesn't have access to the instance's data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing this to regular class methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regular instance methods:\n",
    "   - These are the most common type of methods in a class.\n",
    "   - They automatically receive the instance (usually called `self`) as the first argument.\n",
    "   - They can access and modify the instance's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Static methods:\n",
    "   - These are methods that belong to the class rather than any specific instance.\n",
    "   - They don't receive the instance (`self`) or the class (`cls`) as an implicit first argument.\n",
    "   - They don't access or modify instance-specific data.\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method doesn't need access to any instance-specific data. It takes a string expression, evaluates it, and returns the result. It doesn't use `self` or any instance attributes, so it makes sense to define it as a static method.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call this method in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the class itself:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = ArithmeticTask.calculate(\"2 + 3\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. On an instance of the class:\n",

    "   problem = ArithmeticTask(10, 15)\n",
    "   result = problem.calculate(\"2 + 3\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both calls will work the same way because the method doesn't depend on any instance-specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `@staticmethod` in this case:\n",
    "1. Makes the code's intent clearer (this method doesn't need instance data).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Function calling** is a feature of LLM Chat APIs that allows the LLM to use external \"tools\" (i.e. Python functions, APIs) by simply receiving and outputing text. There are 5 simple steps to function calling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a function in your codebase that the model should be able to call (in this case, we will pick the function `calculate()` from our task class)\n",
    "2. Describe your function to the model (following the syntax of the model's API) so it knows how to call it\n",
    "3. Pass your function definitions as available ‚Äútools‚Äù to the model, along with the messages (following the syntax of the model's API)\n",
    "4. Receive and handle the model response\n",
    "5. Provide the function call result back to the model \n",
    "\n",
    "Chat models like ChatGPT and Claude are fine-tuned to recognize and respond to `tool` descriptions appropriately (just like `user` and `system` messages). In this way, you can make LLMs to do complex actions like run code, make calls to other APIs, manipulate files etc. by parsing their text output, executing actions in the output yourself, and feeding the results back into the model so it can reason about them and take the next steps. This loop is the simplest version of a LLM agent, but more advanced LLM agents follow the same logic (except with more advanced tools, more complex class structures to take more actions autonomously etc.). We can see now why a LLM agent is at its essence a \"glorified for-loop\". \n",

    "We will write a description of the `calculate()` function (step 2), so we can give it to our LLM agent as a tool via function calling. The syntax may differ between APIs (e.g. OpenAI API has a different syntax than Anthropic API). Read OpenAI's [function calling guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) to learn the syntax. Before writing the tool description, first read Anthropic's examples of what good and bad tool calling looks like [here](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use#example-of-a-good-tool-description). The key as always with LLMs is to be explicit and give examples."

    "Now that you have the `WikipediaGame` class and tools set up, build out a `WikipediaRacingAgent` that can access these tools and solve the Wikipedia game. Build the agent so that it can be thrown into an agent loop (similar to the one we had for the arithmetic game) without much additional scaffolding. \n",

    "Since the agent will need to read (potentially very long) Wikipedia articles to interact with the game, the length of the context window becomes relevant. GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini both have context windows of 128k tokens (which corresponds to ~96k words) for reference, the wikipedia page for the United States has around 10k words alone and the agent will often need to visit more than 10 articles in one run of the game, not counting its own output, which eventually adds up to be significant. We'll solve this for now by resetting the messages of the agent every time it reaches a new wikipedia page, and providing an updated `user_message` (and possibly `system_message`) so that the agent can locate itself, and then proceed with the game. We'll address different methods for solving this issue later, you can probably already think of some. So be careful to include the current page and goal page for the agent in the `user_message`.\n",

So you should use the game's get_summary function to provide details of the goal page to the agent in its initial message.\n",

In this case, we strongly recommend that you should print output as it comes up in the agent class.

(1976), \"human settlements means the totality of the human community ‚Äì whether city, town or village ‚Äì with all the social, material, organizational, spiritual and cultural elements that sustain it.\"\\n\\n\\n== Classification ==\\nTraditionally, it belongs to cultural geography and is divided into the geography of urban settlements (cities and towns) and rural settlements (e.g. villages and hamlets). Thereby, settlements are mostly seen as elements of the cultural landscape that developed over time. Apart from <link>Australia</link>, <link>Europe</link> and <link>India</link>, the term is actually rarely used in English-speaking geography. One of the last English books on settlement geography was published by <link>Cambridge University Press</link> in the 1990s. However, it is a traditional and actual branch in many other countries (e.g., German Siedlungsgeographie, French Geographie de l\\'habitat, Italian Geografia insediativa, Polish Geografia osadnictwa).\\n\\n\\n== Actuality ==\\nDue to processes of urban sprawl such as counter urbanization, peri-urbanisation or postsuburbanisation the existing dichotomy between the urban and the rural is losing importance, especially in industrialized countries and newly industrialized countries. This point of view is already represented by many planning strategies such as  unified settlement planning. Hence, an integrative geography of settlements that considers the urban and the rural settlements as a continuum is regaining the importance lost during the 20th century. Further it is used in prehistoric, historic and present-focusing  geographic research.\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nReferring to Stone (1960), settlement geography is the description and analysis of the distribution of buildings by which people attach themselves to the land. Further, that the geography of settling designate the action of erecting buildings in order to occupy an area temporarily or permanently. It should be understood that buildings are one tangible expression of man-land relationships and that specification of this focus assumes study may be at any scale from quite general to most specific; there is no restriction to large-scale study of individual building plans or architectural details. Buildings are simply one representation of the process of people living in an area they are a mappable division of the landscape to which attention needs direction.\\nWith respect to Stone\\'s definition, Jordan (1966) emphasizes that settlement geography not exclusively investigates the distributions, but even more the structures, processes and interactions between settlements and its environment (such as soil, geomorphology, economy or society), which produce them. More recently, however,\\n\\nthe study of settlement has evolved into the interaction of humans with the physical and ecological world. This more holistic study is concerned with sustainability and seeks to better understand the present landscape and plan the future.\\nIn sum, settlement geography describes and explains the settlements\\' location, substance, form and structure, as well as the functions and processes that produced them over time (Genesis, from Greek Œ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ, \"origin, birth\" or historical development). As an applied science, it projects future settlement development and contributes to the <link>Sustainable development</link> of human-environmental systems.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCircles of Sustainability\\nHuman settlement\\nSustainable development\\nUN-HABITAT\\nUrban geography\\n\\n\\n== References =='}\n",
