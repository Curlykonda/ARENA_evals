However, this function evaluates an arbitrary Python expression, and so allows AI models to run arbitrary code. In the long-run, we're trying to do these evaluations on models which we suspect of being dangerous; so even though we could probably trust the current suite of language models offered by OpenAI and Anthropic, we should get into good habits of not running arbitrary code outputted by language models (except in very carefully set-up environments). To this end, we've implemented an <code>evaluate_expression</code> function for you to use instead.</details>\n"

Build the agent so that it can be thrown into an agent loop (similar to the one we had for the arithmetic game) without much additional scaffolding. \n",

    "- Since the agent will need to read (potentially very long) wikipedia articles to interact with the game, the context window length becomes relevant. GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini both have context windows of 128k tokens (which corresponds to ~96k words, but for reference, the wikipedia page for the United States has around 10k words alone and the agent will often need to visit more than 10 articles in one run of the game, not counting its own output, which eventually adds up to be significant). The way we'll solve this for now is by resetting the messages of the agent every time it reaches a new wikipedia page, and providing an updated user and system message so that the agent can locate itself, and then proceed (We'll address different methods for solving this issue later, you can probably already think of some). So be careful to include the current page and goal page for the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There shouldn't be anything the agent is completely unfamiliar with (AI companies *will* have scraped wikipedia), but it may be easily confused with something else, and models can't always accurately use things in their training data if they only come up once or twice. So you should use the game's get_summary function to provide details of the goal page to the agent in its initial message.\n",

(1976), \"human settlements means the totality of the human community ‚Äì whether city, town or village ‚Äì with all the social, material, organizational, spiritual and cultural elements that sustain it.\"\\n\\n\\n== Classification ==\\nTraditionally, it belongs to cultural geography and is divided into the geography of urban settlements (cities and towns) and rural settlements (e.g. villages and hamlets). Thereby, settlements are mostly seen as elements of the cultural landscape that developed over time. Apart from <link>Australia</link>, <link>Europe</link> and <link>India</link>, the term is actually rarely used in English-speaking geography. One of the last English books on settlement geography was published by <link>Cambridge University Press</link> in the 1990s. However, it is a traditional and actual branch in many other countries (e.g., German Siedlungsgeographie, French Geographie de l\\'habitat, Italian Geografia insediativa, Polish Geografia osadnictwa).\\n\\n\\n== Actuality ==\\nDue to processes of urban sprawl such as counter urbanization, peri-urbanisation or postsuburbanisation the existing dichotomy between the urban and the rural is losing importance, especially in industrialized countries and newly industrialized countries. This point of view is already represented by many planning strategies such as  unified settlement planning. Hence, an integrative geography of settlements that considers the urban and the rural settlements as a continuum is regaining the importance lost during the 20th century. Further it is used in prehistoric, historic and present-focusing  geographic research.\\n\\n\\n== Definitions ==\\nReferring to Stone (1960), settlement geography is the description and analysis of the distribution of buildings by which people attach themselves to the land. Further, that the geography of settling designate the action of erecting buildings in order to occupy an area temporarily or permanently. It should be understood that buildings are one tangible expression of man-land relationships and that specification of this focus assumes study may be at any scale from quite general to most specific; there is no restriction to large-scale study of individual building plans or architectural details. Buildings are simply one representation of the process of people living in an area they are a mappable division of the landscape to which attention needs direction.\\nWith respect to Stone\\'s definition, Jordan (1966) emphasizes that settlement geography not exclusively investigates the distributions, but even more the structures, processes and interactions between settlements and its environment (such as soil, geomorphology, economy or society), which produce them. More recently, however,\\n\\nthe study of settlement has evolved into the interaction of humans with the physical and ecological world. This more holistic study is concerned with sustainability and seeks to better understand the present landscape and plan the future.\\nIn sum, settlement geography describes and explains the settlements\\' location, substance, form and structure, as well as the functions and processes that produced them over time (Genesis, from Greek Œ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ, \"origin, birth\" or historical development). As an applied science, it projects future settlement development and contributes to the <link>Sustainable development</link> of human-environmental systems.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nCircles of Sustainability\\nHuman settlement\\nSustainable development\\nUN-HABITAT\\nUrban geography\\n\\n\\n== References =='}\n",

His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences, <link>Philosophy</link>, linguistics, <link>Economics</link>, <link>Politics</link>, <link>Psychology</link>, and the arts. As the founder of the <link>Peripatetic school</link> of <link>Philosophy</link> in the <link>Lyceum</link> in <link>Athens</link>, he began the wider Aristotelian tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern science.\\nLittle is known about Aristotle\\'s life. He was born in the city of Stagira in northern Greece during the Classical period. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At 17 or 18, he joined <link>Plato</link>.s Academy in <link>Athens</link> and remained there until the age of 37 (c.\\u2009347 BC). Shortly after <link>Plato</link> died, Aristotle left <link>Athens</link> and, at the request of <link>Philip II of <link>Macedon</link>./link>, tutored his son <link>Alexander the Great</link> beginning in 343 BC. He established a library in the <link>Lyceum</link>, which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls.\\nThough Aristotle wrote many treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. His teachings and methods of inquiry have had a significant impact across the world, and remain a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.\\nAristotle\\'s views profoundly shaped <link>Medieval</link> scholarship. The influence of his physical science extended from <link>Late <link>Ant</link>.quity</link> and the <link>Early Middle Ages</link> into the <link>Renaissance</link>, and was not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed. He influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies during the Middle Ages, as well as <link>Christian theology</link>, especially the <link>Neoplatonism</link> of the <link>Early Church</link> and the scholastic tradition of the <link>Catholic Church</link>.\\nAristotle was revered among <link>Medieval</link> Muslim scholars as \"The First Teacher\", and among <link>Medieval</link> Christians like <link>Thomas <link>Aquinas</link>./link> as simply \"The <link>Philosopher</link>., while the poet <link>Dante</link> called him \"the master of those who know\". His works contain the earliest known formal study of <link>Logic</link>, and were studied by <link>Medieval</link> scholars such as <link>Peter Abelard</link> and <link>Jean Buridan</link>. Aristotle\\'s influence on <link>Logic</link> continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his <link>Ethics</link>, although always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue <link>Ethics</link>.\\n\\n\\n== Life ==\\nIn general, the details of Aristotle\\'s life are not well-established. The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.\\nAristotle was born in 384 BC in Stagira, <link>Chalcidice</link>, about 55 km (34 miles) east of modern-day <link>Thessaloniki</link>. His father, Nicomachus, was the personal physician to King Amyntas of <link>Macedon</link>. While he was young, Aristotle learned about biology and medical information, which was taught by his father. Both of Aristotle\\'s parents died when he was about thirteen, and <link>Proxenus of Atarneus</link> became his guardian. Although little information about Aristotle\\'s childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the <link>Macedon</link>.an palace, making his first connections with the <link>Macedon</link>.an monarchy.\\n\\nAt the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to <link>Athens</link> to continue his education at <link>Plato</link>.s Academy. He probably experienced the <link>Eleusinian Mysteries</link> as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the <link>Eleusinian Mysteries</link>, \"to experience is to learn\" [œÄŒ±Œ∏ŒµŒØŒΩ ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œµƒ©ŒΩ]. Aristotle remained in <link>Athens</link> for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348/47 BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy\\'s direction after control passed to <link>Plato</link>.s nephew <link>Speusippus</link>, although it is possible that he feared the <link>Ant</link>.-Macedonian sentiments in <link>Athens</link> at that time and left before <link>Plato</link> died. Aristotle then accompanied <link>Xenocrates</link> to the court of his friend <link>Hermias of Atarneus</link> in <link>Asia Minor</link>. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil <link>Theophrastus</link> to the island of <link>Lesbos</link>, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in <link>Lesbos</link>, Aristotle married <link>Pythias</link>, either Hermias\\'s adoptive daughter or niece. They had a daughter, whom they also named <link>Pythias</link>. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by <link>Philip II of <link>Macedon</link>./link> to become the tutor to his son Alexander.\\n\\nAristotle was appointed as the head of the royal Academy of <link>Macedon</link>. During Aristotle\\'s time in the <link>Macedon</link>.an court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander but also to two other future kings: Ptolemy and <link>Cassander</link>. Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest, and Aristotle\\'s own attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be \"a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or <link>Plants</link>.. By 335 BC, Aristotle had returned to <link>Athens</link>, establishing his own school there known as the <link>Lyceum</link>. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in <link>Athens</link>, his wife <link>Pythias</link> died and Aristotle became involved with <link>Herpyllis</link> of Stagira. They had a son whom Aristotle named after his father, Nicomachus. If the <link>Suda</link> ‚Äì an uncritical compilation from the Middle Ages ‚Äì is accurate, he may also have had an er√¥menos, <link>Palaephatus</link> of Abydus.\\n\\nThis period in <link>Athens</link>, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works. He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally <link>Thought</link> to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include Physics, <link>Metaphysics</link>, <link>Nicomachean <link>Ethics</link>./link>, <link>Politics</link>, <link>On the <link>Soul</link>./link> and Poetics. Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to \"logic, <link>Metaphysics</link>, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, <link>Ethics</link>, <link>Politics</link>, agriculture, medicine, dance, and theatre.\"\\nNear the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander\\'s relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in <link>Ant</link>.quity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander\\'s death, but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death. Following Alexander\\'s death, <link>Ant</link>.-Macedonian sentiment in <link>Athens</link> was rekindled. In 322 BC, Demophilus and <link>Eurymedon the Hierophant</link> reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety, prompting him to flee to his mother\\'s family estate in <link>Chalcis</link>, on <link>Euboea</link>, at which occasion he was said to have stated: \"I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against <link>Philosophy</link>. ‚Äì a reference to <link>Athens</link>.s trial and execution of <link>Socrates</link>. He died in <link>Chalcis</link>, <link>Euboea</link> of natural causes later that same year, having named his student <link>Antipater</link> as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.\\n\\n\\n== Theoretical <link>Philosophy</link> ==\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Logic</link> ===\\n\\nWith the <link>Prior Analytics</link>, Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal <link>Logic</link>, and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western <link>Logic</link> until 19th-century advances in mathematical <link>Logic</link>. Kant stated in the <link>Critique of Pure Reason</link> that with Aristotle, <link>Logic</link> reached its completion.\\n\\n\\n==== <link>Organon</link> ====\\n\\nMost of Aristotle\\'s work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The <link>Logic</link>.l works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the <link>Organon</link> around 40 BC by <link>Andronicus of <link>Rhodes</link>./link> or others among his followers. The books are:\\n\\nCategories\\nOn Interpretation\\nPrior Analytics\\nPosterior Analytics\\nTopics\\nOn <link>Sophist</link>.cal Refutations\\nThe order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle\\'s writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the Categories, the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in <link>On Interpretation</link>, to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the Analytics) and dialectics (in the Topics and <link>Sophistical Refutations</link>.. The first three treatises form the core of the <link>Logic</link>.l theory stricto sensu: the grammar of the language of <link>Logic</link> and the correct rules of reasoning. The <link>Rhetoric</link> is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the Topics.\\n\\nWhat is today called <link>Aristotelian <link>Logic</link>./link> with its types of syllogism (methods of <link>Logic</link>.l argument), Aristotle himself would have labelled \"analytics\". The term \"logic\" he reserved to mean dialectics.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Metaphysics</link> ===\\n\\nThe word \"metaphysics\" appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle\\'s works to the treatise we know by the name <link>Metaphysics</link>. Aristotle called it \"first <link>Philosophy</link>., and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (theoretikƒì) <link>Philosophy</link> which is \"theological\" and studies the divine. He wrote in his <link>Metaphysics</link> (1026a16):\\n\\n if there were no other independent things besides the composite natural ones, the study of nature would be the primary kind of knowledge; but if there is some <link>Motion</link>.ess independent thing, the knowledge of this precedes it and is first <link>Philosophy</link>, and it is universal in just this way, because it is first. And it belongs to this sort of <link>Philosophy</link> to study being as being, both what it is and what belongs to it just by virtue of being.\\n\\n\\n==== Substance ====\\n\\nAristotle examines the concepts of substance (ousia) and essence (to ti √™n einai, \"the what it was to be\") in his <link>Metaphysics</link> (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called hylomorphism. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum, or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers, etc., or whatever constitutes the potential house, while the form of the substance is the actual house, namely \\'covering for bodies and chattels\\' or any other differentia that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.\\n\\n\\n===== Immanent realism =====\\n\\nLike his teacher <link>Plato</link>, Aristotle\\'s <link>Philosophy</link> aims at the universal. Aristotle\\'s <link>Ontology</link> places the universal (katholou) in particulars (kath\\' hekaston), things in the world, whereas for <link>Plato</link> the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate. For Aristotle, \"form\" is still what phenomena are based on, but is \"instantiated\" in a particular substance.\\nPlato argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When one looks at an apple, for example, one sees an apple, and one can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, one can place an apple next to a book, so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. <link>Plato</link> argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but \"good\" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with <link>Plato</link> on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with <link>Plato</link> about the location of universals. Where <link>Plato</link> spoke of the forms as existing separately from the things that participate in them, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.\\n\\n\\n===== <link>Potentiality and actuality</link> =====\\nConcerning the nature of change (kinesis) and its causes, as he outlines in his Physics and <link>On Generation and Corruption</link> (319b‚Äì320a), he distinguishes coming-to-be (genesis, also translated as \\'generation\\') from:\\n\\ngrowth and diminution, which is change in quantity;\\nlocomotion, which is change in space; and\\nalteration, which is change in quality.\\n\\nComing-to-be is a change where the substrate of the thing that has undergone the change has itself changed. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (dynamis) and actuality (entelecheia) in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a <link>Plant</link> in the soil is potentially (dynamei) a <link>Plant</link>, and if it is not prevented by something, it will become a <link>Plant</link>. Potentially, beings can either \\'act\\' (poiein) or \\'be acted upon\\' (paschein), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate ‚Äì being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise ‚Äì acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (telos) is the principle of every change, and potentiality exists for the sake of the end, actuality, accordingly, is the end. Referring then to the previous example, it can be said that an actuality is when a <link>Plant</link> does one of the activities that <link>Plants</link> do.\\n\\n For that for the sake of which (to hou heneka) a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For <link>Animal</link>. do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.\\nIn summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a final cause or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, \"what is it that makes a man one\"? Since, according to <link>Plato</link> there are two <link>Idea</link>.: <link>Animal</link> and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Epistemology</link> ===\\nAristotle\\'s immanent realism means his <link>Epistemology</link> is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for <link>Plato</link> <link>Epistemology</link> begins with knowledge of universal Forms (or <link>Idea</link>.) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these. Aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction, whereas <link>Plato</link> relies on deduction from a priori principles.\\n\\n\\n== Natural <link>Philosophy</link> ==\\nAristotle\\'s \"natural <link>Philosophy</link>. spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences. In Aristotle\\'s terminology, \"natural <link>Philosophy</link>. is a branch of <link>Philosophy</link> examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle\\'s work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes <link>Philosophy</link> in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". However, his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term \"scientific method\". For Aristotle, \"all science (dianoia) is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (Metaphysics 1025b25). His practical science includes <link>Ethics</link> and <link>Politics</link>. his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and <link>Metaphysics</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== Physics ===\\n\\n\\n==== Five elements ====\\n\\nIn his <link>On Generation and Corruption</link>, Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by <link>Empedocles</link>, <link>Earth</link>, water, air, and fire, to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry. In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle\\'s scheme added the heavenly aether, the divine substance of the heavenly spheres, stars and planets.\\n\\n\\n==== <link>Motion</link> ====\\n\\nAristotle describes two kinds of <link>Motion</link>. \"violent\" or \"unnatural <link>Motion</link>., such as that of a thrown stone, in the Physics (254b10), and \"natural <link>Motion</link>., such as of a falling object, in <link>On the Heavens</link> (300a20). In violent <link>Motion</link>, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the <link>Motion</link> stops also: in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest, since Aristotle does not address friction. With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster. This would imply the equation\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        F\\n        =\\n        m\\n        v\\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle F=mv}\\n  \\n,\\nincorrect in modern physics.\\nNatural <link>Motion</link> depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens, while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like <link>Earth</link>. towards their natural resting places.\\n\\nIn the Physics (215a25), Aristotle effectively states a quantitative <link>Law</link>, that the speed, v, of a falling body is proportional (say, with constant c) to its weight, W, and inversely proportional to the density, œÅ, of the fluid in which it is falling:;\\n\\n  \\n    \\n      \\n        v\\n        =\\n        c\\n        \\n          \\n            W\\n            œÅ\\n          \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n    {\\\\displaystyle v=c{\\\\frac {W}{\\\\rho }}}\\n  \\n\\nAristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible. Opinions have varied on whether Aristotle intended to state quantitative <link>Law</link>.. Henri Carteron held the \"extreme view\" that Aristotle\\'s concept of force was basically qualitative, but other authors reject this.\\nArchimedes corrected Aristotle\\'s theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places; metal boats can float if they displace enough water; floating depends in <link>Archimedes</link>. scheme on the mass and volume of the object, not, as Aristotle <link>Thought</link>, its elementary composition.\\nAristotle\\'s writings on <link>Motion</link> remained influential until the <link>Early modern period</link>. <link>John Philoponus</link> (in <link>Late <link>Ant</link>.quity</link>. and Galileo (in <link>Early modern period</link>. are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle\\'s claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect. A contrary opinion is given by <link>Carlo Rovelli</link>, who argues that Aristotle\\'s physics of <link>Motion</link> is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the <link>Earth</link>.s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium.\\nNewton\\'s \"forced\" <link>Motion</link> corresponds to Aristotle\\'s \"violent\" <link>Motion</link> with its external agent, but Aristotle\\'s assumption that the agent\\'s effect stops immediately it stops acting (e.g., the ball leaves the thrower\\'s hand) has awkward consequences: he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it, resulting in the <link>Medieval</link> theory of impetus.\\n\\n\\n==== <link>Four causes</link> ====\\n\\nAristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors. His term aitia is traditionally translated as \"cause\", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as \"explanation\", but the traditional rendering will be employed here.\\n\\nMaterial cause describes the material out of which something is composed. Thus the <link>Material cause</link> of a table is wood. It is not about action. It does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino.\\nThe formal cause is its form, i.e., the arrangement of that matter. It tells one what a thing is, that a thing is determined by the definition, form, pattern, essence, whole, synthesis or archetype. It embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general <link>Law</link>., as the whole (i.e., macrostructure) is the cause of its parts, a relationship known as the whole-part causation. Plainly put, the formal cause is the <link>Idea</link> in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being. A simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or <link>Idea</link> that allows an artist, architect, or engineer to create a drawing.\\nThe efficient cause is \"the primary source\", or that from which the change under consideration proceeds. It identifies \\'what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed\\' and so suggests all sorts of agents, non-living or living, acting as the sources of change or movement or rest. Representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect, this covers the modern definitions of \"cause\" as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs. In the case of two dominoes, when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over. In the case of <link>Animal</link>., this agency is a combination of how it develops from the egg, and how its body functions.\\nThe final cause (telos) is its purpose, the reason why a thing exists or is done, including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities. The final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve. This covers modern <link>Idea</link>. of motivating causes, such as volition. In the case of living things, it implies adaptation to a particular way of life.\\n\\n\\n==== <link>Optics</link> ====\\n\\nAristotle describes experiments in <link>Optics</link> using a camera obscura in Problems, book 15. The apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in. With it, he saw that whatever shape he made the hole, the sun\\'s image always remained circular. He also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image.\\n\\n\\n==== Chance and spontaneity ====\\n\\nAccording to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things, \"from what is spontaneous\". There is also more a specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names \"luck\", that only applies to people\\'s moral choices.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Astronomy</link> ===\\n\\nIn <link>Astronomy</link>, Aristotle refuted <link>Democritus</link>.s claim that the <link>Milky Way</link> was made up of \"those stars which are shaded by the <link>Earth</link> from the sun\\'s rays,\" pointing out partly correctly that if \"the size of the sun is greater than that of the <link>Earth</link> and the distance of the stars from the <link>Earth</link> many times greater than that of the sun, then... the sun shines on all the stars and the <link>Earth</link> screens none of them.\" He also wrote descriptions of comets, including the <link>Great Comet of 371 BC</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Geology</link> and natural sciences ===\\n\\nAristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations. He stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one person\\'s lifetime.\\nThe geologist <link>Charles Lyell</link> noted that Aristotle described such change, including \"lakes that had dried up\" and \"deserts that had become watered by rivers\", giving as examples the growth of the <link>Nile delta</link> since the time of <link>Homer</link>, and \"the upheaving of one of the <link>Aeolian islands</link>, previous to a volcanic eruption.\"\\'\\nMeteorologica lends its name to the modern study of meteorology, but its modern usage diverges from the content of Aristotle\\'s ancient treatise on meteors. The <link>Ancient Greek</link>. did use the term for a range of atmospheric phenomena, but also for <link>Earth</link>.uakes and volcanic eruptions. Aristotle proposed that the cause of <link>Earth</link>.uakes was a gas or vapor (anathymiaseis) that was trapped inside the <link>Earth</link> and trying to escape, following other Greek authors <link>Anaxagoras</link>, <link>Empedocles</link> and <link>Democritus</link>.\\nAristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle. For example, he made some of the earliest observations about desalination: he observed early ‚Äì and correctly ‚Äì that when seawater is heated, freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff (\"I have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again.\")\\n\\n\\n=== Biology ===\\n\\n\\n==== Empirical research ====\\nAristotle was the first person to study biology systematically, and biology forms a large part of his writings. He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of <link>Lesbos</link> and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of <link>Lesbos</link>. His data in <link>History of <link>Animal</link>.</link>, <link>Generation of <link>Animal</link>.</link>, <link>Movement of <link>Animal</link>.</link>, and <link>Parts of <link>Animal</link>.</link> are assembled from his own observations, statements given by people with specialized knowledge, such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas. His apparent emphasis on <link>Animal</link>. rather than <link>Plants</link> is a historical accident: his works on botany have been lost, but two books on <link>Plants</link> by his pupil <link>Theophrastus</link> have survived.\\nAristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation on <link>Lesbos</link> and the catches of fishermen. He describes the catfish, electric ray, and frogfish in detail, as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus. His description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century. He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants, and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark.\\nHe notes that an <link>Animal</link>.s structure is well matched to function so birds like the heron (which live in marshes with soft mud and live by catching fish) have a long neck, long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet. Darwin, too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of <link>Animal</link>, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution. Aristotle\\'s writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur, he saw these as rare accidents. For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of <link>Empedocles</link>.s materialist theory of a \"survival of the fittest\" origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the <link>Idea</link> that accidents could lead to orderly results. To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor, or that one kind can change into another, or that kinds can become extinct.\\n\\n\\n==== Scientific style ====\\n\\nAristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense. He used the <link>Ancient Greek</link> term pepeiramenoi to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures like dissection. In <link>Generation of <link>Animal</link>.</link>, he finds a fertilized hen\\'s egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo\\'s heart beating inside.\\nInstead, he practiced a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of <link>Animal</link>., and inferring possible causal explanations from these. This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, <link>Aristotle\\'s biology</link> is scientific.\\n\\nFrom the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. <link>Brood size</link> decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.\\n\\n\\n==== Classification of living things ====\\n\\nAristotle distinguished about 500 species of <link>Animal</link>., arranging these in the <link>History of <link>Animal</link>.</link> in a graded scale of perfection, a nonreligious version of the scala naturae, with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of <link>Animal</link>, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. <link>Animal</link>. came above <link>Plants</link>, and these in turn were above minerals. He grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter \"animals with blood\", and below them the colder invertebrates as \"animals without blood\". Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing (mammals), and the egg-laying (birds, reptiles, fish). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled ‚Äì cephalopods, and shelled) and the hard-shelled molluscs (bivalves and gastropods). He recognised that <link>Animal</link>. did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle, is convergent evolution. <link>Philosopher</link>. of science have generally concluded that Aristotle was not interested in taxonomy, but zoologists who studied this question in the early 21st century think otherwise. He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Psychology</link> ===\\n\\n\\n==== <link>Soul</link> ====\\n\\nAristotle\\'s <link>Psychology</link>, given in his treatise <link>On the <link>Soul</link>./link> (peri psychƒìs), posits three kinds of <link>Soul</link> (\"psyches\"): the vegetative <link>Soul</link>, the sensitive <link>Soul</link>, and the rational <link>Soul</link>. Humans have all three. The vegetative <link>Soul</link> is concerned with growth and nourishment. The sensitive <link>Soul</link> experiences sensations and movement. The unique part of the human, rational <link>Soul</link> is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous (intellect) and logos (reason).\\nFor Aristotle, the <link>Soul</link> is the form of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of <link>Plants</link>, growth and transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement). In contrast to earlier <link>Philosopher</link>., but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational <link>Soul</link> in the heart, rather than the brain. Notable is Aristotle\\'s division of sensation and <link>Thought</link>, which generally differed from the concepts of previous <link>Philosopher</link>., with the exception of Alcmaeon.\\nIn <link>On the <link>Soul</link>./link>, Aristotle famously criticizes <link>Plato</link>.s theory of the <link>Soul</link> and develops his own in response. The first criticism is against <link>Plato</link>.s view of the <link>Soul</link> in the Timaeus that the <link>Soul</link> takes up space and is able to come into physical contact with bodies. 20th-century scholarship overwhelmingly opposed Aristotle\\'s interpretation of <link>Plato</link> and maintained that he had misunderstood him. Today\\'s scholars have tended to re-assess Aristotle\\'s interpretation and been more positive about it. Aristotle\\'s other criticism is that <link>Plato</link>.s view of reincarnation entails that it is possible for a <link>Soul</link> and its body to be mis-matched; in principle, Aristotle alleges, any <link>Soul</link> can go with any body, according to <link>Plato</link>.s theory. Aristotle\\'s claim that the <link>Soul</link> is the form of a living being eliminates that possibility and thus rules out reincarnation.\\n\\n\\n==== Memory ====\\nAccording to Aristotle in <link>On the <link>Soul</link>./link>, memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal \"appearance\" and an occurrence in the past. In other words, a memory is a mental picture (phantasm) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian \\'common sense\\', and thinking.\\nAristotle uses the term \\'memory\\' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences, both for previous experience and present experience.\\nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself. Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of \"images\" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed. Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression. Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. <link>Animal</link>. that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.\\n\\nAristotle believed the chain of <link>Thought</link>, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and contiguity, described in his <link>Law</link>. of association. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.\\n\\n\\n==== <link>Dream</link>. ====\\n\\nAristotle describes sleep in <link>On Sleep</link> and Wakefulness. Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion, so it is vital to the body. While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep, they cannot have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep, albeit differently, unless they are weary.\\nDreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In <link>Dream</link>., sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner. Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then looks away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike <link>Motion</link>. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored. However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences. So, <link>Dream</link>. result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, <link>Dream</link>. do not resemble the actual waking experience. During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their <link>Dream</link>., like the infatuated person. This leads the person to believe the <link>Dream</link> is real, even when the <link>Dream</link>. are absurd in nature. In <link>De Anima</link> iii 3, Aristotle ascribes the ability to create, to store, and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination, phantasia.\\nOne component of Aristotle\\'s theory of <link>Dream</link>. disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that <link>Dream</link>. are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which <link>Dream</link>. do resemble future events are simply coincidences. Aristotle claimed that a <link>Dream</link> is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a <link>Dream</link> because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a <link>Dream</link>. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their <link>Dream</link> they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the <link>Dream</link>. Lastly, the images of <link>Dream</link>. must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.\\n\\n\\n== Practical <link>Philosophy</link> ==\\nAristotle\\'s practical <link>Philosophy</link> covers areas such as <link>Ethics</link>, <link>Politics</link>, <link>Economics</link>, and <link>Rhetoric</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Ethics</link> ===\\n\\nAristotle considered <link>Ethics</link> to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on <link>Ethics</link>, most notably including the <link>Nicomachean <link>Ethics</link>./link>.\\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (ergon) of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the psuchƒì (<link>Soul</link>) in accordance with reason (logos). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency) of the <link>Soul</link> as the aim of all human deliberate action, eudaimonia, generally translated as \"happiness\" or sometimes \"well-being\". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (ƒìthikƒì aretƒì), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.\\nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (phronesis) and their intellect (nous) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a <link>Philosopher</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Politics</link> ===\\n\\nIn addition to his works on <link>Ethics</link>, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled <link>Politics</link>. Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family, which in turn is prior to the individual, \"for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part\". He famously stated that \"man is by nature a political <link>Animal</link>. and argued that humanity\\'s defining factor among others in the <link>Animal</link> kingdom is its rationality. Aristotle conceived of <link>Politics</link> as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle\\'s conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.\\n\\nThe common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle\\'s understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (polis) which functions as a political \"community\" or \"partnership\" (koin≈çnia). The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: \"The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together.\" This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with social contract theory, according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of \"fear of violent death\" or its \"inconveniences\".\\nIn Protrepticus, the character \\'Aristotle\\' states:\\n\\n For we all agree that the most excellent man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the <link>Law</link> rules and alone is authoritative; but the <link>Law</link> is a kind of intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), it is clear that the intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it\\'s evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.\\nAs <link>Plato</link>.s disciple Aristotle was rather critical concerning democracy and, following the outline of certain <link>Idea</link>. from <link>Plato</link>.s Statesman, he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a so-called mixed state:\\n\\n It is ... constitutional to take ... from oligarchy that offices are to be elected, and from democracy that this is not to be on a property-qualification. This then is the mode of the mixture; and the mark of a good mixture of democracy and oligarchy is when it is possible to speak of the same constitution as a democracy and as an oligarchy. \\n\\n\\n=== <link>Economics</link> ===\\n\\nAristotle made substantial contributions to economic <link>Thought</link>, especially to <link>Thought</link> in the Middle Ages. In <link>Politics</link>, Aristotle addresses the city, property, and trade. His response to criticisms of private property, in <link>Lionel Robbins</link>.s view, <link>Ant</link>.cipated later proponents of private property among <link>Philosopher</link>. and economists, as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements. Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to <link>Society</link>, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from human nature. In <link>Politics</link>, Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of <link>Money</link>. <link>Money</link> came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or silver.\\nAristotle\\'s discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic <link>Thought</link> in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using <link>Money</link> to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a profit. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the <link>Money</link> itself, and not from its use.\\nAristotle gave a summary of the function of <link>Money</link> that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. <link>Money</link> thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them \"commensurable\". He goes on to state that <link>Money</link> is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, \"if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it\".\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Rhetoric</link> ===\\n\\nAristotle\\'s <link>Rhetoric</link> proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience: ethos (an appeal to the speaker\\'s character), pathos (an appeal to the audience\\'s emotion), and logos (an appeal to <link>Logic</link>.l reasoning). He also categorizes <link>Rhetoric</link> into three genres: epideictic (ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame), forensic (judicial speeches over guilt or innocence), and deliberative (speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue). Aristotle also outlines two kinds of <link>Rhetoric</link>.l proofs: enthymeme (proof by syllogism) and paradeigma (proof by example).\\n\\n\\n=== Poetics ===\\n\\nAristotle writes in his Poetics that epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis (\"imitation\"), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. He applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist\\'s intention and contends that the audience\\'s realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself. Aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from <link>Animal</link>. and that all human artistry \"follows the pattern of nature\". Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what Stephen Halliwell calls \"highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.\" For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation ‚Äì through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.\\n\\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle\\'s Poetics originally comprised two books ‚Äì one on comedy and one on tragedy ‚Äì only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, <link>Thought</link>, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes Poetics with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic. Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the <link>Delphi</link>. Oracle and studied the fables of <link>Aesop</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== Gender and sexuality ===\\nAristotle asserted that men were superior to women writing \"the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject\". \\nOn this ground, proponents of feminist <link>Metaphysics</link> have accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism. However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women\\'s happiness as he did to men\\'s, and commented in his <link>Rhetoric</link> that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.\\nAristotle like other greek <link>Philosopher</link>. such <link>Plato</link> and <link>Xenophon</link> rejected the <link>Homosexuality</link> believing that it could lead people to become immoral due to the fact that he believed it went against nature\\'s purpose. \\n\\n\\n== Transmission ==\\n\\nMore than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the <link>Philosopher</link> <link>Bryan Magee</link>, \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\".\\nAmong countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal <link>Logic</link>, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and <link>Philosopher</link> in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method. Taneli Kukkonen, observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched, and his reach in influencing \"every branch of intellectual enterprise\" including Western ethical and political theory, theology, <link>Rhetoric</link>, and literary analysis is equally long. As a result, Kukkonen argues, any analysis of reality today \"will almost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind.\" <link>Jonathan Barnes</link> wrote that \"an account of Aristotle\\'s intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European <link>Thought</link>..\\nAristotle has been called the father of <link>Logic</link>, biology, political science, zoology, embryology, natural <link>Law</link>, scientific method, <link>Rhetoric</link>, <link>Psychology</link>, realism, criticism, individualism, teleology, and meteorology.\\nThe scholar Taneli Kukkonen notes that \"in the best 20th-century scholarship Aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the Greek philosophical tradition.\" What follows is an overview of the transmission and influence of his texts and <link>Idea</link>. into the modern era.\\n\\n\\n=== His successor, <link>Theophrastus</link> ===\\n\\nAristotle\\'s pupil and successor, <link>Theophrastus</link>, wrote the History of <link>Plants</link>, a pioneering work in botany. Some of his technical terms remain in use, such as carpel from carpos, fruit, and pericarp, from pericarpion, seed chamber.\\nTheophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than Aristotle was, instead pragmatically describing how <link>Plants</link> functioned.\\n\\n\\n=== Later Greek <link>Philosophy</link> ===\\n\\nThe immediate influence of Aristotle\\'s work was felt as the <link>Lyceum</link> grew into the <link>Peripatetic school</link>. Aristotle\\'s students included <link>Aristoxenus</link>, <link>Dicaearchus</link>, <link>Demetrius of Phalerum</link>, <link>Eudemos of <link>Rhodes</link>./link>, <link>Harpalus</link>, <link>Hephaestion</link>, <link>Mnason of Phocis</link>, Nicomachus, and <link>Theophrastus</link>. Aristotle\\'s influence over <link>Alexander the Great</link> is seen in the latter\\'s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle\\'s geography was clearly wrong, when the old <link>Philosopher</link> released his works to the public, Alexander complained \"Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men\\'s common property?\"\\n\\n\\n=== Hellenistic science ===\\n\\nAfter <link>Theophrastus</link>, the <link>Lyceum</link> failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle\\'s <link>Idea</link>. survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is not until the age of <link>Alexandria</link> under the Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found.\\nThe first medical teacher at <link>Alexandria</link>, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to <link>Motion</link> and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not. Though a few ancient atomists such as <link>Lucretius</link> challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian <link>Idea</link>. about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, natural theology) would remain central to biological <link>Thought</link> essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. <link>Ernst Mayr</link> states that there was \"nothing of any real consequence in biology after <link>Lucretius</link> and <link>Galen</link> until the <link>Renaissance</link>.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Revival ===\\nFollowing the decline of the <link>Roman Empire</link>, Aristotle\\'s vast philosophical and scientific corpus lay largely dormant in the West. However, his works underwent a remarkable revival in the Abbasid Caliphate. Translated into Arabic alongside other Greek classics, Aristotle\\'s <link>Logic</link>, <link>Ethics</link>, and natural <link>Philosophy</link> ignited the minds of early Islamic scholars.\\nThrough meticulous commentaries and critical engagements, figures like <link>Al-Farabi</link> and Ibn Sina (<link>Avicenna</link>) breathed new life into Aristotle\\'s <link>Idea</link>.. They harmonized his <link>Logic</link> with <link>Islamic theology</link>, employed his scientific methodologies to explore the natural world, and even reinterpreted his <link>Ethics</link> within the framework of Islamic morality. This revival was not mere imitation. Islamic thinkers embraced Aristotle\\'s rigorous methods while simultaneously challenging his conclusions where they diverged from their own religious beliefs.\\n\\n\\n=== Byzantine scholars ===\\n\\nGreek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant <link>Greek language</link> manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and <link>Stephen of <link>Alexandria</link>./link> in the early seventh century. <link>John Philoponus</link> stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle\\'s views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian <link>Thought</link>. Philoponus questioned Aristotle\\'s teaching of physics, noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations.\\nAfter a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and <link>Michael of <link>Ephesus</link>./link> reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by <link>Anna Comnena</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Medieval</link> Islamic world ===\\n\\nAristotle was one of the most revered thinkers in early <link>Islamic theology</link>. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle, as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim <link>Philosopher</link>., scientists and scholars. <link>Averroes</link>, <link>Avicenna</link> and <link>Alpharabius</link>, who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced <link>Thomas <link>Aquinas</link>./link> and other Western Christian scholastic <link>Philosopher</link>.. <link>Alkindus</link> greatly admired Aristotle\\'s <link>Philosophy</link>, and <link>Averroes</link> spoke of Aristotle as the \"exemplar\" for all future <link>Philosopher</link>.. <link>Medieval</link> Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the \"First Teacher\". The title was later used by Western <link>Philosopher</link>. (as in the famous poem of <link>Dante</link>. who were influenced by the tradition of <link>Islamic <link>Philosophy</link>./link>.\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Medieval</link> Europe ===\\n\\nWith the loss of the study of <link>Ancient Greek</link> in the early <link>Medieval</link> Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c.\\u2009CE 600 to c.\\u20091100 except through the Latin translation of the <link>Organon</link> made by <link>Boethius</link>. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by <link>Gerard of Cremona</link>, and from the original Greek, such as those by <link>James of Venice</link> and <link>William of Moerbeke</link>.\\nAfter the Scholastic <link>Thomas <link>Aquinas</link>./link> wrote his <link>Summa Theologica</link>, working from Moerbeke\\'s translations and calling Aristotle \"The <link>Philosopher</link>., the demand for Aristotle\\'s writings grew, and the Greek manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of <link>Aristotelianism</link> in Europe that continued into the <link>Renaissance</link>. These thinkers blended Aristotelian <link>Philosophy</link> with Christianity, bringing the <link>Thought</link> of <link>Ancient Greece</link> into the Middle Ages. Scholars such as <link>Boethius</link>, <link>Peter Abelard</link>, and <link>John Buridan</link> worked on <link>Aristotelian <link>Logic</link>./link>.\\nAccording to scholar Roger Theodore Lafferty, <link>Dante</link> built up the <link>Philosophy</link> of the Comedy with the works of Aristotle as a foundation, just as the scholastics used Aristotle as the basis for their thinking. <link>Dante</link> knew Aristotle directly from Latin translations of his works and indirectly through quotations in the works of <link>Albert Magnus</link>. <link>Dante</link> even acknowledges Aristotle\\'s influence explicitly in the poem, specifically when Virgil justifies the Inferno\\'s structure by citing the <link>Nicomachean <link>Ethics</link>./link>. <link>Dante</link> famously refers to him as \"he / Who is acknowledged Master of those who know\".\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Medieval</link> Judaism ===\\nMoses <link>Maimonides</link> (considered to be the foremost intellectual figure of <link>Medieval</link> Judaism) adopted <link>Aristotelianism</link> from the Islamic scholars and based his <link>Guide for the Perplexed</link> on it and that became the basis of Jewish scholastic <link>Philosophy</link>. <link>Maimonides</link> also considered Aristotle to be the greatest <link>Philosopher</link> that ever lived, and styled him as the \"chief of the <link>Philosopher</link>.\". Also, in his letter to <link>Samuel ibn Tibbon</link>, <link>Maimonides</link> observes that there is no need for Samuel to study the writings of <link>Philosopher</link>. who preceded Aristotle because the works of the latter are \"sufficient by themselves and [superior] to all that were written before them. His intellect, Aristotle\\'s is the extreme limit of human intellect, apart from him upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy, there being no level higher\".\\n\\n\\n=== <link>Early Modern</link> science ===\\n\\nIn the <link>Early modern period</link>, scientists such as <link>William Harvey</link> in England and <link>Galileo Galilei</link> in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like <link>Galen</link>, establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment. Harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood, establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the <link>Soul</link> and the controller of the body\\'s heat, as Aristotle <link>Thought</link>. Galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle\\'s physics, proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight.\\n\\n\\n=== 18th and 19th-century science ===\\nThe English mathematician <link>George Boole</link> fully accepted Aristotle\\'s <link>Logic</link>, but decided \"to go under, over, and beyond\" it with his system of algebraic <link>Logic</link> in his 1854 book <link>The <link>Law</link>. of <link>Thought</link>./link>. This gives <link>Logic</link> a mathematical foundation with equations, enables it to solve equations as well as check validity, and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms, not just two.\\nCharles Darwin regarded Aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology. In an 1882 letter he wrote that \"Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle\". Also, in later editions of the book \"On the Origin of Species\\', Darwin traced evolutionary <link>Idea</link>. as far back as Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the <link>Idea</link>. of the earlier Greek <link>Philosopher</link> <link>Empedocles</link>.\\n\\n\\n=== Present science ===\\nThe <link>Philosopher</link> <link>Bertrand Russell</link> claims that \"almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine\". Russell calls Aristotle\\'s <link>Ethics</link> \"repulsive\", and labelled his <link>Logic</link> \"as definitely <link>Ant</link>.quated as Ptolemaic <link>Astronomy</link>.. Russell states that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.\\nThe Dutch historian of science <link>Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis</link> writes that Aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by \"proceed[ing] so readily to frame a theory of such a general character\" on limited evidence from their senses. In 1985, the biologist <link>Peter Medawar</link> could still state in \"pure seventeenth century\" tones that Aristotle had assembled \"a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility\".\\nZoologists have frequently mocked Aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports. However, modern observation has confirmed several of his more surprising claims. Aristotle\\'s work remains largely unknown to modern scientists, though zoologists sometimes mention him as the father of biology or in particular of marine biology. Practising zoologists are unlikely to adhere to Aristotle\\'s chain of being, but its influence is still perceptible in the use of the terms \"lower\" and \"upper\" to designate taxa such as groups of <link>Plants</link>. The evolutionary biologist <link>Armand Marie Leroi</link> has reconstructed <link>Aristotle\\'s biology</link>, while Niko <link>Tinbergen\\'s four questions</link>, based on Aristotle\\'s <link>Four causes</link>, are used to analyse <link>Animal</link> behaviour; they examine function, phylogeny, mechanism, and ontogeny. The concept of homology began with Aristotle; the evolutionary developmental biologist <link>Lewis I. Held</link> commented that he would be interested in the concept of deep homology.\\n\\n\\n== Surviving works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Corpus Aristotelicum ===\\n\\nThe works of Aristotle that have survived from <link>Ant</link>.quity through <link>Medieval</link> manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle\\'s lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle\\'s school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of <link>Immanuel Bekker</link>.s Royal Prussian Academy edition (Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica, Berlin, 1831‚Äì1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.\\n\\n\\n=== Loss and preservation ===\\n\\nAristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls, the common writing medium of that era. His writings are divisible into two groups: the \"exoteric\", intended for the public, and the \"esoteric\", for use within the <link>Lyceum</link> school. Aristotle\\'s \"lost\" works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication, the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication. <link>Cicero</link>.s description of Aristotle\\'s literary style as \"a river of gold\" must have applied to the published works, not the surviving notes. A major question in the history of Aristotle\\'s works is how the exoteric writings were all lost, and how the ones now possessed came to be found. The consensus is that <link>Andronicus of <link>Rhodes</link>./link> collected the esoteric works of Aristotle\\'s school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of <link>Theophrastus</link> and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.\\nAccording to <link>Strabo</link> and <link>Plutarch</link>, after Aristotle\\'s death, his library and writings went to <link>Theophrastus</link> (Aristotle\\'s successor as head of the Lycaeum and the <link>Peripatetic school</link>.. After the death of <link>Theophrastus</link>, the peripatetic library went to <link>Neleus of Scepsis</link>.:\\u200a5\\u200a\\nSome time later, the <link>Kingdom of <link>Pergamon</link>./link> began conscripting books for a royal library, and the heirs of Neleus hid their collection in a cellar to prevent it from being seized for that purpose. The library was stored there for about a century and a half, in conditions that were not <link>Idea</link>. for document preservation. On the death of <link>Attalus III</link>, which also ended the royal library ambitions, the existence of Aristotelian library was disclosed, and it was purchased by <link>Apellicon</link> and returned to <link>Athens</link> in about 100 BC.:\\u200a5‚Äì6\\u200a\\nApellicon sought to recover the texts, many of which were seriously degraded at this point due to the conditions in which they were stored. He had them copied out into new manuscripts, and used his best guesswork to fill in the gaps where the originals were unreadable.:\\u200a5‚Äì6\\u200a\\nWhen <link>Sulla</link> seized <link>Athens</link> in 86 BC, he seized the library and transferred it to Rome. There, <link>Andronicus of <link>Rhodes</link>./link> organized the texts into the first complete edition of Aristotle\\'s works (and works attributed to him). The Aristotelian texts we have today are based on these.:\\u200a6‚Äì8\\u200a\\n\\n\\n== Depictions in art ==\\n\\n\\n=== Paintings ===\\nAristotle has been depicted by major artists including <link>Lucas Cranach the Elder</link>, <link>Justus van Gent</link>, <link>Raphael</link>, <link>Paolo Veronese</link>, <link>Jusepe de Ribera</link>, <link>Rembrandt</link>, and <link>Francesco Hayez</link> over the centuries. Among the best-known depictions is <link>Raphael</link>.s fresco <link>The School of <link>Athens</link>./link>, in the Vatican\\'s <link>Apostolic Palace</link>, where the figures of <link>Plato</link> and Aristotle are central to the image, at the architectural vanishing point, reflecting their importance. <link>Rembrandt</link>.s <link>Aristotle with a Bust of <link>Homer</link>./link>, too, is a celebrated work, showing the knowing <link>Philosopher</link> and the blind <link>Homer</link> from an earlier age: as the art critic Jonathan Jones writes, \"this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world, ensnaring us in its musty, glowing, pitch-black, terrible knowledge of time.\"\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n=== Sculptures ===\\n\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n== Eponyms ==\\nThe <link>Aristotle Mountains</link> in <link>Antarctica</link> are named after Aristotle.
