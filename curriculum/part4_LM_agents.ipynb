    "\n",
    "Now that you have the `WikipediaGame` class and the tooling set up, build out a `WikipediaRacingAgent` that can access these tools and solve the wikipedia game. Build the agent so that it can be thrown into an agent loop (similar to the one we had for the arithmetic game) without much additional scaffolding. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few further considerations in this case that we didn't have for the arithmetic game. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the agent will need to read (potentially very long) wikipedia articles to interact with the game, the context window length becomes relevant. GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini both have context windows of 128k tokens (which corresponds to ~96k words, but for reference, the wikipedia page for the United States has around 10k words alone and the agent will often need to visit more than 10 articles in one run of the game, not counting its own output, which eventually adds up to be significant). The way we'll solve this for now is by resetting the messages of the agent every time it reaches a new wikipedia page, and providing an updated user and system message so that the agent can locate itself, and then proceed (We'll address different methods for solving this issue later, you can probably already think of some). So be careful to include the current page and goal page for the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There shouldn't be anything the agent is completely unfamiliar with (AI companies *will* have scraped wikipedia), but it may be easily confused with something else, and models can't always accurately use things in their training data if they only come up once or twice. So you should use the game's get_summary function to provide details of the goal page to the agent in its initial message.\n",
