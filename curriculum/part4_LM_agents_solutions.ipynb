For reference, the wikipedia page for the United States has around 10k words alone and the agent will often need to visit more than 10 articles in one run of the game, not counting its own output, which eventually adds up to be significant. We'll solve this for now by resetting the messages of the agent every time it reaches a new wikipedia page, and providing an updated `user_message` (and possibly `system_message`) so that the agent can locate itself, and then proceed with the game.
