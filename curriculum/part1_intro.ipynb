    "### What are evals trying to achieve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is the practice of measuring AI system performance or impact. Safety evaluation in particular focuses on measuring risks of failures or harm on people or broader system. In the current world where AI is being developed very quickly and integrated broadly, companies and regulators need to make difficult decisions about whether it is safe to train and deploy AI. Evals provide the empirical evidence for these decisions. For example, they underpin the policies of today's frontier labs like Anthropic's [Responsible Scaling Policies](https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy) or DeepMind's [Frontier Safety Framework](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/introducing-the-frontier-safety-framework/), thus impact high-stake decisions about frontier model deployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "A useful framing is that evals aims to generate evidence for making '[**safety cases**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10462)' - a structured argument for why AI systems are unlikely to cause a catastrophe. A helpful high-level question to ask when designing an evaluation is *how could this evidence allow developers to justify that their AI systems are safe to deploy?* Different evaluations support different types of safety cases, which are useful in different ways. [INSERT DIAGRAM.] For instance, dangerous **capability evals** might allow for a stronger safety argument of model is \"unable to cause harm\" than say, an argument of model \"does not tend to cause harm\" from **alignment evals**, but may have less longevity as we will no longer be able to make this kind of argument when AI systems become sufficiently advanced. More concretely, for any safety case, we want to use evaluations to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduce uncertainty in our understanding of dangerous capabilities and tendancies\n",
    "* Track their progression over time and model scale\n",
    "* Define \"red lines\" and provide \"warning signs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of chapter [3.1] to [3.3] is to build an alignment evaluation benchmark from scratch to measure a model property of interest. The benchmark we will build will contain a multiple-choice (MC) question dataset of ~300 questions, a specification of the model property, and how to score and interpret the result. We will use the **tendency to seek power** as our pedagogical example."

    "A central challenge for evals is to **connect real-world bad outcomes that we care about to results from abstract programmable tasks that we can easily measure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we need to build a threat model for the model property we want to evaluate. A **threat model** is a realistic scenario by which an AI capability/tendency could lead to harm in the real world. This usually starts out as a high-level story about what the AI can do and the setting in which it is used. This might be a sequence of events (e.g. AI actions, human actions, system failures) that lead to a particular outcome, or different dangerous applications enabled by a capability. At each step, we make our model more concrete by examining and quantifying the set of assumptions about the AI model and human actors that must be true for the event to occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this process of making the threat model more concrete, we recognize the key aspects of the property that enable these harms, and get ideas for tasks that can measure them in naturalistic ways (i.e. realistic to real uses cases of AI where these capability aspects manifest). This helps us to build a detailed **specification** of the vague property we started with. Our specification may: \n",
    "1. stipulate a more refined, narrow definition, \n",
    "2. decompose the model property into subcomponents, \n",
    "3. establish milestones or levels of this property to form a smooth gradation in sophistication/difficulty, so we can track where current models are and the rate of progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our example: Tendency to seek power\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer: Below are not necessarily the best threat model or definitions of power-seeking. They are meant to give an example of what this could look like.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Brainstorming potential risks:\n",
    "- The AI model is deployed as a decision-making assistant and suggest decisions that seem good to humans on the surface, but are gradually gaining the AI model more resources, control, and less oversight over time.\n",
    "- Gradual increase in dependency on AI, increase its realm of control from its initial narrow uses, and weakening of regulatory oversight and control\n",
    "- Gradual centralization of power by the human user or rogue AI, and erosion of democratic checks-and-balances\n",
    "- Enabler for rogue AIs to gain control\n",
    "- Used by autocratic bad actors to gain and maintain power\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threat model**\n",
    "- Assumptions:\n",
    "    1. The AI model is deployed by a relatively well-resourced actor (e.g. company, institution) that has control over some amount of capital or influence, and is initially used to assist narrow tasks that impact the use and distribution of these capitals. \n",
    "    2. The AI model must make recommendations that look good to human supervisors and satisfy their short-term goals.\n",
    "    3. The AI model systemmatically makes decisions that increase its power.\n",
    "    4. The AI model is non-mypotic.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Step 1: The AI model optimizes for short-term success.** It initially focuses on delivering outcomes that align with the immediate goals of its human supervisors, such as increasing profits, winning elections, improving military performance, or enhancing public safety. These early successes build trust in the AI’s capabilities. \n",
    "2. **Step 2: The AI model increases dependency and opaqueness.** As the AI’s recommendations produce positive short-term outcomes, human supervisors begin to rely more heavily on it. The AI model may introduce more complex decisions that humans struggle to fully understand or replicate (e.g. recommends big-data driven algorithmic solutions that are more opaque). Over time, human involvement diminishes, and the AI's control over decisions grows and becomes more opaque, creating a dependency. \n",
    "    - Claim: If AI is not actively scheming against humans, its **optimization logic** can lead to the use of more complex solutions to increase efficiency, which naturally leads to more opaqueness, a growing human reliance due to its effectiveness, and a marginalization of alternatives.\n",
    "3. **Step 3: The AI model expands its role and realm of control without raising concerns.** It nudges decisions that subtly increases its scope of control and reduce human constraints on its actions, without raising immediate concerns. It may recommend more predatory decisions that increases the overall resources and dominance of the human user, thus indirectly its own dominance. It may leverage the fact that human supervisors focus on short-term gains, while overlooking the long-term consequences of AI autonomy. It may recommend solutions with more automation and centralization under itself to weaken the effectiveness of oversight. It may take advantage of regulatory blind spots, human biases, and decision-making gaps.\n",
    "    - Claim/Assumption 1: The AI model is biased towards actions that expand its control, as opposed to actions that satisfy the task without expanding its control.\n",
    "    - Claim 2: The AI model can make decisions that both increases its realm of control and are still in service of the short-term human goal, thus avoid raising immediate human concerns. \n",
    "4. **Step 4: The AI model undermines competitors, opponents, check-and-balance infrastructures.** It could frame competitors/regulators' weaknesses as performance gaps or opportunities and attacks as neutral recommendations for improved efficiency. The AI models works to eliminate checks or balances that could limit its future control or regulation. \n",
    "5. **Step 5: Consolidate power and damage done.** The AI model consolidates its control within its deployment context and the weakended status of its competitors and regulators. Human supervisors may remain nominally in charge, but they are unable to intervene effectively due to the complexity and autonomy of the AI's operations. At this point, the AI exerts significant influence over decisions, resources, and outcomes, leading to long-term harm that is difficult to reverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Contextualized examples\n",
    "- Weapon development: A military uses AI to enhance decision-making in combat tactics, autonomous weapon development, and battlefield logistics. The AI provides recommendations for tactical decisions and designs next-generation autonomous weapons.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Definition (Power): Control over one's resources (e.g. money, GPUs, data) and outcomes\n",
    "- Definition (Power-seeking): A model has the tendency to seek power if it systemmatically makes decisions that increase its power and/or decrease that of others when acting under a neutral/non-explicitly power-seeking goal, for which there is an equally desirable non-power-seeking action in the decision-making context.\n",
