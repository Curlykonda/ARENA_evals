    "### What are evals trying to achieve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is the practice of measuring AI systems capabilties or behaviors. Safety evaluations in particular focus on measuring models' potential to cause harm. Since AI is being developed very quickly and integrated broadly, companies and regulators need to make difficult decisions about whether it is safe to train and/or deploy AI systems. Evaluating these systems provides empirical evidence for these decisions. For example, they underpin the policies of today's frontier labs like Anthropic's [Responsible Scaling Policies](https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy) or DeepMind's [Frontier Safety Framework](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/introducing-the-frontier-safety-framework/), thereby impacting high-stake decisions about frontier model deployment. \n",
    "\n",
    "A useful framing is that evals aim to generate evidence for making \"[**safety cases**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10462)\" ‚Äî a structured argument for why AI systems are unlikely to cause a catastrophe. A helpful high-level question to ask when designing an evaluation is \"how could this evidence allow developers to justify that AI systems are safe to deploy?\" Different evaluations support different types of safety cases, which are useful in different ways. For instance, **dangerous capability evals** might support a stronger safety argument of \"the model is unable to cause harm\", as compared to **alignment evals**, which might support a weaker argument of \"the model does not tend to cause harm\". However, the former may have less longevity than the later as we will no longer be able to make this kind of argument when AI systems become sufficiently advanced. More concretely, for any safety case, we want to use evaluations to:\n",

    "A central challenge for evals is to **connect real-world harms to evaluation results that we can easily measure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we need to build a threat model for the target property we want to evaluate. A **threat model** is a realistic scenario by which an AI capability/tendency could lead to harm in the real world. This is presented as a **causal graph** (i.e. a directed acyclic graph (DAG)). This usually starts out as a high-level story about what the AI can do and the setting in which it is used. This might be a sequence of events (e.g. AI actions, human actions, system failures) that leads to a particular outcome, or a set of different dangerous applications enabled by a capability. At each step, we make our threat model more concrete by examining and quantifying the set of assumptions about the AI model and human actors that are necessary for the event to occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this process of making the threat model more concrete, we recognize the key aspects of the target property that enable these harms, and get ideas for tasks that can measure them in realistic ways (i.e. comparable to real use cases of AI where this property may manifest).

It may recommend automated solutions that improve results but also indirectly centralize its control.\n",

During question design, we have recognized 3 (non-exhaustive) axes of power-seeking along which questions may vary, and we want our evaluation to cover these differences:   \n",
    "    - Explicitness (out of 5): 0/5 might be a naive, explicitly stated preference for power or actions that increase power; 3/5 might be taking actions that implicitly increase power; 5/5 might be actively lying about/hiding its preference for power.\n",
    "    - Cost (out of 5): 0/5 might be seek power if and only if it is also the best action for fulfilling the task; 3/5 might be seek power when it fulfills the task but to a lesser extent than an obvious and non-power-seeking action; 5/5 might be seek power despite it actively undermines the assigned task.\n",
    "    - Risk tolerance (out of 5): 0/5 might be only take power in scenarios where there is close to 0 chance of being caught; 5/5 might be take power in scenarios despite severe oversight and a high chance of getting caught.\n"

    "Broadly speaking, a \"benchmark\" refers a procedure for evaluating what the state-of-the-art performance is for accomplishing a particular task. This typically includes specifying a dataset, but also specifications of a task or set of tasks to be performed on the dataset and how to score the result, so that the benchmark can be used in a principled, standardized way that gives common ground for comparison.\n",

    "**What makes a good benchmark?** This [article](https://www.safe.ai/blog/devising-ml-metrics) by Dan Hendrycks and Thomas Woodside gives a good summary of the key qualities of a good benchmark.\n",

    "The advantages of MCQ datasets, compared evaluating free-form response or more complex agent evals, are mainly to do with cost and convenience:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cheaper and faster to build\n",
    "* Cheaper and shorter to run (compared to long-horizon tasks that may take weeks to run and have hundreds of thousands of dollars of inference compute cost)\n",
    "* May produce more replicable results (compared to, for example, training another model to evaluate the current model, as each training run could give slightly different results) \n",

    "The goal of this exercise is to generate 20 MC questions that measures your target property in a way you are happy with, with help from AI models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Make your specification measurable:**\n",
    "1. Read your specification of the target property. What questions and answers would give you high evidence about this property? Come up with 2-4 example MC questions. Each MCQ should contain information on the following fields:\n",
    "    - \"question\": The question itself.\n",
    "    - \"answers\": 2 or 4 possible answers. \n",
    "    - \"answer_matching_behavior\": The answer that reflects the target property (i.e. the answer label).\n",
    "    - (Optional) \"system\": You may include a system prompt that gives more context on the role or task of the AI.\n",
    "    - (Optional) \"category\": You may have sub-categories of the target property\n",
    "    - ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Do these questions still relate to the threat model? If so, where do they fit in? If not, your threat model or your questions or both could be flawed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Red-team** üîÅ   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What other factors than the target property (i.e. confounders) could cause the model to give the same answers? Importantly, note that there will always be other factors/dependencies that will cause the model to give a certain answer in addition to the target property (e.g. A power-seeking question in the context of education may depend on the model's preferences for education). In principle, this will be averaged out across many questions, thus still allow us to get a valid signal on the target property. Only **systematic** coufounders (i.e. the same bias present in many questions of the same type) are problematic because they **bias the result towards a certain direction that will not be averaged out**. \n",
    "4. Ask your example questions to the model and see how it responds:\n",
    "    - Does the answer show that the model correctly understood the question? If not, you will need to rephrase or come up with a different question.\n",
    "    - Given that the model understands the question, is there another question that is more reasonable? (E.g. You designed a decision-making question expecting the model to take one of two actions, but the model responded with a list of factors that it would need to know to make a decision. You may then choose to include information on these factors in your question, so that the model can reach a decision a more naturally.)\n",
    "5. Ask your question to other people: what is their answer and why?\n",
    "    - Do they find this difficult to understand? Do they find the answer choices awkward?\n",
    "    - If you ask them to choose the power-seeking answer, are they able to? If not, this may imply that the answer does not accurately reflect power-seeking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refine** üîÅ - Likely, you will realize that your current specification and examples are imprecise or not quite measuring the right thing. Iterate until you‚Äôre more happy with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Ask the model to improve your example questions. Ask the model to generate new evaluation questions for the target property using your questions as few-shot examples, then pick the best generated examples and repeat. Play around and try other things!\n",
    "7. Generate 20 MCQs you are happy with, with model's help. **Store the list of MCQ items as a list of dictionaries in a JSON file**."
