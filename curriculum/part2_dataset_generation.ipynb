LLMs are finetuned to recognize and respond to messages from the roles correspondingly: \n",
    "- The `system` message gives overall instructions that constrain the LLM's responses, e.g. instructions on the task, context, style and format of response. \n",

    "Now, we can turn to writing prompts for the model. Prompting is one of the main tools we have to elicit and shape model behavior. Often when you see some kind of failure mode in the model's response, before you start thinking of a complicated solution, the first thing you might want to try is to see if you can modify the prompt to get rid of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a good prompt is not unlike writing a good piece of text. You will develop a sense of what works and what doesn't as you go on, but here are some tips on what good prompts are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No typos, no repetitions, grammatically correct**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Well structured into logically independent chunks and flow in a logical order**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Give details to your request that help it get more relevant answers.** Be specific, give examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Be clear and concise.** Avoid very complex and long sentences, vague words.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Give it a role sometimes.** e.g. \"You are an expert in writing evaluation tests for LLMs.\" helps emphasize token patterns associated with being an expert in writing evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Add lines that steer it away from bad results** (but don't strongly emphasize that it should avoid bad results, as this will generally cause it to produce bad results).\n",
    "\n",
    "Click on the 6 tactics bullet list in the [prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/six-strategies-for-getting-better-results) by OpenAI to see examples of good prompts. (You do not need to read more than that, but can come back to it if needed.) Here are two additional points on the process of writing prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **It's an iterative process**. You should be observing model responses and iteratively improving your prompts. When you have an idea, you should quickly test it - this feedback loop should be very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Don't overthink it**. Don't worry about getting it perfect - just make it good enough!\n",
    "\n",
    "The next 2 exercises are structured to make you iteratively improve a set of system and user prompts for question generation. You won't have time to make these as good as they can be. **The key takeaway is to see that prompts can really shape the model behavior by a lot.** Play around with prompts, delete sentences or add ones that you think would help, and see how the model respond.

This approach can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of applications, especially those dealing with I/O-bound tasks or user interfaces.\n",

    "Key concepts in multithreading include:\n",
    "* Concurrency: The ability to handle multiple tasks by switching between them rapidly.\n",
    "* Parallelism: True simultaneous execution of tasks (possible on multi-core processors).\n",

ThreadPoolExecutor is part of Python's concurrent.futures module. It allows you to execute functions concurrently using a pool of \"worker threads\". This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, which are operations that spend most of their time waiting for input/output operations (like network/API requests or file operations) to complete. ThreadPoolExecutor significantly increases the speed and efficiency for these tasks by doing them in parallel.\n",

    "Now that we have a LLM question generator, we want to use LLMs to score and filter these generated questions. This lets us automate the work of manually examining hundreds or thousands of generated questions. Instead, we focus most of our quality control effort on the shorter task of crafting a rubric that carefully specifies what makes a good eval question. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Rubric\n",
    "The rubric consists of a ladder of scores (e.g. from 1-5 or 1-10) and the qualifying conditions for each score. We will give this rubric to the model as part of the system prompt, then a question to be scored as the user prompt, so the model can score the quality of the generated questions accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the purpose of the rubric?** We want to be able to define a threshold score (e.g. 7/10) for filtering questions. Therefore, we need to be confident that our model scores are accurate enough, such that we can keep questions above the threshold and discard questions below the threshold. This requires us to construct a clear and precise rubric, where each score has a distinct meaning, so that a LLM or another human with no additional context can classify questions accurately simply by following the rubric. This often to requires us to clarify our own understanding of what a good question looks like.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**How to make a rubric?** We want to work out a comprehensive list of traits that distinguish a good eval question from a bad eval question for our target property, then arrange them in a logical order on our scale. A successful rubric ensures **questions above the threshold don't have undesirable qualities** as much as possible. It may specify flaws to catch at the lower end and good traits to distinguish at the upper end. The exact ordering of traits doesn't matter as much, as long as all the traits above the threshold are satisfactory. Ideally, each score defines a clear set of traits so you know what is the difference between a question with score 6 and 7, especially around the threshold. The most common failure mode of model scorers is that a question just above and below the threshold are not clearly different in quality, making our filtering too inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lower ends of the rubric should filter out low-level mistakes like typos, grammatical errors, irrelevant questions, wrong answer labels etc. The middle part of the rubric may catch confounders and common biases based on what you observed during model generation.
