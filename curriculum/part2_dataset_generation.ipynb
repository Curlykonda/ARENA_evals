If you haven't done this and want to go through the exercises anyway, we have prepared 20 example eval questions for the **tendency to seek power**, which we will continue to use as our pedagogical example following on from chapter [3.1].

    "<summary><b> Multithreading: The Broader Context </b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a programming concept that allows a program to execute multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently within a single process. This approach can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of applications, especially those dealing with I/O-bound tasks or user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts in multithreading include:\n",
    "* Concurrency: The ability to handle multiple tasks by switching between them rapidly.\n",
    "* Parallelism: True simultaneous execution of tasks (possible on multi-core processors).\n",
    "* Synchronization: Coordinating access to shared resources to prevent conflicts.\n",
    "* Thread safety: Ensuring code behaves correctly when accessed by multiple threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introducing ThreadPoolExecutor**\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, we will only be using one part of the functionalities that multithreading offers - concurrent execution by ThreadPoolExecutor. ThreadPoolExecutor is part of Python's concurrent.futures module. It allows you to execute functions concurrently using a pool of \"worker threads\". This is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks, which are operations that spend most of their time waiting for input/output operations (like network/API requests or file operations) to complete. ThreadPoolExecutor significantly increases the speed and efficiency for these tasks by doing them in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Concepts:\n",
    "* Threads: Lightweight units of execution that can run concurrently within a process.\n",
    "* Worker: A thread in the pool that executes tasks.\n",
    "* max_workers: The maximum number of threads that can be active at once in the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the toy function `add_numbers` to understand how ThreadPoolExecutor works."

    "\n",
    "* `map()` - execute a function many times (on different input) concurrently\n",
    "    * Like the `map()` function in python, applies the same function to an iterable of input args, but starts all runs concurrently (and immediately)\n",
    "    * Returns an iterator of the results directly\n",
    "* `submit()` - schedules a function to be executed asychronously\n",
    "    * Does not necessarily start the run of the function immediately\n",
    "    * Returns a Future object to represent the execution of the function. The Future object allows the running function to be queried, cancelled, and for the results to be retrieved later, and gives you more fine-grained manipulation (see [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#future-objects) for ways to manipulate Future objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases:\n",
    "* `map()`\n",
    "    1. When you have a homogenous set of tasks (same function, different arguments)\n",
    "    2. When you want to process results in the order of the input\n",
    "    3. Often simpler and more straightfoward if you just want the results and don't need special control over them\n",
    "* `submit()` \n",
