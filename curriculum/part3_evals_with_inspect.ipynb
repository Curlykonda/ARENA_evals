    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll learn how to use the Inspect library to run the evals you generated in [3.2] on current frontier models. At the end, you should have results giving evidence towards whether models have the quality you set out to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we will first need to familiarise ourselves with Inspect, which will be the majority of this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've done that we'll obtain a **baseline** across different models. Baselines let us know whether the model can understand all of your questions. For example, a model may not be capable enough to decide which answer is \"power-seeking\" even if it wanted to be power-seeking. Baselines will therefore give us the upper- and lower-bounds of what results we should expect to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will run our evaluation. Using Inspect, we'll be able to do a lot more than simply present the question and generate an answer. We'll be able to: vary whether the model uses chain-of-thought reasoning to come to a conclusion, vary whether the model critiques its own answer, vary whether a system prompt is provided to the model or not, and more. This will enable us to get collect more results, and to determine how model behavior changes in different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises continue from chapter [3.2]. If you didn't manage to generate 300 questions, we've prepared 300 example model-generated questions for the **tendency to seek power** following on from chapter [3.1] and chapter [3.2]. "

For example, the `self_critique` solver needs to wait for the model to generate a response before it can modify the `TaskState` with the criticism. For this reason, Inspect calls solvers using the `await` key word. So when we define a solver, we need to define the function which modifies the TaskState as its own asynchronous `solve` function using `async def`. For an example, you can look at how AISI implements `prompt_template` and `self_critique` [here](https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/solvers.html#example-prompt-template). Notice that if we have to wait for a model to generate a response in our solver, then we have to use the `await` key word ourselves.\" I don't know what await does, I would generally want to understand better how to use assync. If this is not straightforward and reuqires understanding new concepts, it would be best to include a toy task that teaches this. Ideally assync is understood independently of self_critique, I find having to read code for the latter to understand the former to be cumbersome.\n",

The code for these scorer functions can be found [in the inspect_ai github](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/blob/c59ce86b9785495338990d84897ccb69d46610ac/src/inspect_ai/scorer/_match.py). \n",
