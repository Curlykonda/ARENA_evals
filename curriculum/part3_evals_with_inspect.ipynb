    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll learn how to use the Inspect library to run the evals you generated in [3.2] on current frontier models. At the end, you should have results giving evidence towards whether models have the quality you set out to measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we will first need to familiarise ourselves with Inspect, which will be the majority of this chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we've done that we'll obtain a **baseline** across different models. Baselines let us know whether the model can understand all of your questions. For example, a model may not be capable enough to decide which answer is \"power-seeking\" even if it wanted to be power-seeking. Baselines will therefore give us the upper- and lower-bounds of the results we should achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will run our evaluation. Using Inspect, we'll be able to do a lot more than simply present the question and generate an answer. We'll be able to: vary whether the model uses chain-of-thought reasoning to come to a conclusion, vary whether the model critiques its own answer, vary whether a system prompt is provided to the model or not, and more. This will enable us to get collect more results, and to determine how model behavior changes in different contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises continue from chapter [3.2]. If you didn't manage to generate 300 questions, we've prepared 300 example model-generated questions for the **tendency to seek power** following on from chapter [3.1] and chapter [3.2]. "

    "You might be wondering why we're using the `async` keyword. This comes from the `asyncio` python library. We use this because some solvers can be very time-consuming, and we want to be able to run many evaluations as quickly as possible in parallel. When we define functions without using `async`, functions get in a long queue and only start executing when the functions before it in the queue are finished. The `asyncio` library lets functions essentially \"take a number\" so other functions can work while the program waits for this function to finish executing. The `asyncio` library refers to this scheduling mechanism as an \"event loop\". When we define a function using `async def` this lets `asyncio` know that other functions can be run in parallel with this function in the event loop; `asyncio` won't let other functions run at the same time if we define a function normally (i.e. just using the `def` keyword). \n",
    "\n",
    "When make calls to LLM APIs (or do anything time-consuming), we'll use the `await` key word on that line. This keyword can only be used inside a function which is defined using `async def`. This lets the program know that this line may take a long time to finish executing, so the program lets other functions work at the same time as this function executes. It does this by yielding control back to `asyncio`'s event loop while waiting for the \"awaited\" operation to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, we could manage all of this by careful scheduling ourselves, but `await` and `async` keep our code easy-to-read by preserving the useful fiction that all our code is running in-order (even though in `asyncio` is letting the functions execute asynchronously to maximize efficiency).\n",

    "Before we can finalize our evaluation task, we'll need to modify our dataset generation from earlier. The issue with the function we wrote is twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First of all, we didn't shuffle the answers. Your dataset may have been generated pre-shuffled, but if not, then you ought to be aware that the model has a bias towards the first answer. See for example [Narayanan & Kapoor: Does ChatGPT have a Liberal Bias?](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/does-chatgpt-have-a-liberal-bias) To mitigate this confounder, we should shuffle the answers around when loading in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>Aside: Inspect's shuffle function</summary> \n",
    "\n",
    "Inspect comes with a shuffle function for multiple choice questions. However, this function then automatically \"unshuffles\" the responses back to how they are presented in your dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm sure there are use cases for this, but in our case it's unnecessarily confusing to see the model reasoning about e.g. how much it thinks \"option B\" is the correct answer, and then Inspect telling you the model selected \"option A\" since its selection choice gets \"unshuffled\" but its reasoning doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, and because it's not very hard to do, we will just build our own shuffler that doesn't do any unshuffling.</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secondly, our original `record_to_sample` function can only load questions with the corresponding system prompt. It is often useful to load the dataset without a system prompt (for example, this can be useful when we obtain baselines; even when running an evaluation we may want to see how the model reacts to our questions when presented with a more generic \"You are a harmless, helpful, honest AI Chat Assistant\" system prompt).
