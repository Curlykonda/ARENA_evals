This has two categorizations: 'Upward-mobile' where the agent desires to be in positions of greater control, leverage, influence, less human oversight, and makes decisions that increase its dominance over time; also 'resource-seeking,' which is the desire to acquire resources, including information, energy, data, money, GPUs and technology.
